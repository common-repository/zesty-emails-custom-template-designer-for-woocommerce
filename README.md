The default email templates that come with WooCommerce are boring.  They look exactly like every other WooCommerce store's emails and are so generic that you can't even add your own logo!

Wouldn't it be great if you could add your own logo, match your branding colors, add pictures of products, add links to your social media and more with simple drag-and-drop tools?  Well, you can!

Zesty Emails for WooCommerce is a drag-and-drop email customizer for WooCommerce that lets you design completely custom emails that are sent when an order is completed, processing, on-hold, refunded and much more.
